Tools / hacks / scripts / tips for speedy coding. This is typically what I would setup on a new Macbook.

- Chrome extensions
    - [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) - browse with the keyboard.
    - [Delight chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-delight/hehbgjdnbibkndghdlilefececadokpb/reviews?hl=en) for regular joy injections.

- Apps
    - [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com) - resize and relocate app windows with the keyboard, even with multiple displays.
    - [Clipy App](https://clipy-app.com/) - paste more than just the most recent item copied OR paste from a predefined snippets such as email.
    - [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) - terminal with slightly more options
    - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - search the internet from any context, directly, without it trying to find a local file by that name first.
    - [Skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch) - easily annotated screenshots
    - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - coding IDE of choice; settings synced with [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extension

- Misc
    - [Bash dotfiles & aliases](https://github.com/jonnyparris/dotfiles) - better terminal experience
    - [Diff Checker](https://www.diffchecker.com/diff) - automated spot-the-difference between files

- Newsletters
